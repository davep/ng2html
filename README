Welcome to v1.05 of ng2html.

ng2html was developed for and on Linux, however, it should compile
clean in most environments. I know for sure that it works under Dos
with DJGPP v2.0 or better and I'm told it compiles ok with Microsoft
C++ 4.1.

Note that if you are building ng2html under Dos with a 16bit compiler
you probably want to uncomment the line that reads:

	/* #define _16_BIT_COMPILER_ */

You'll find it at around line 147.

Please read the manual page for full details, I've included the source
(ng2html.1) and a formatted version (ng2html.man).

Any feedback is welcome, contact me at davep@davep.org. The latest version
of ng2html is always available from my pages at:
